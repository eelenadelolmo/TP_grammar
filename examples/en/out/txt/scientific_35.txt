 Comparison of the observed and expected distribution of test statistics showed some evidence for an inflation of the test statistics in both stage 1 (inflation factor λ=1.03, 95_% confidence interval (CI) 1.02 – 1.04) and stage 2 (λ=1.06, 95_% CI 1.04 – 1.12), based on the 90_% least significant SNPs (Fig. 1).
